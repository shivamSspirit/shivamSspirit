# Hi, I'm Shivam üëã  

Solana Developer | Product Builder | Technical Writer | DevRel Enthusiast

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve transitioned from building Reactjs-based applications to becoming a full-fledged Solana developer, with experience in product development, technical writing, and developer relations (DevRel). My journey in the blockchain space has been about creating educational tools, contributing to open-source projects, and fostering growth in the Solana ecosystem.  

## üöÄ What I've Built:  
1. **Solidity on Solana** ‚Äì A crash course on building on Solana using Solang-Solidity ([solidityOnsolana](https://github.com/shivamSspirit/Solang-Series)).  
2. **SolQuest** ‚Äì The first decentralized learning platform on Solana Blockchain ([Sol_quest](https://github.com/shivamSspirit/solana-quest)).


## üõ†Ô∏è Open Source Contributions:  
I've made meaningful code contributions to various Solana-based repositories, including:

- [Web3 Examples](https://github.com/solana-developers/web3-examples/pull/4)   
- [Solana Cookbook](https://github.com/solana-developers/web3-examples/pull/8)  
- [Solana Program Examples](https://github.com/solana-developers/solana-cookbook/pull/531)  
- [Solana developer content](https://github.com/solana-foundation/developer-content/pull/309)  

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing and Tutorials:

## üöÄ Featured Projects

## [Solidity on Solana](https://solang-series-git-main-shivamsoni00s-projects.vercel.app)

**Description**: The Solang Series is a collection of tutorials and code examples demonstrating how to build smart contracts on Solana using Solang, a Solidity-compatible compiler for 
 Solana. This project is a crash course designed to help developers familiar with Solidity transition to writing smart contracts on Solana‚Äôs blockchain.

**Tech Stack**: Solana Blockchain, Solidity, Solang, JavaScript, MDX, Nextjs, Reactjs

## [SolQuest](https://solquest.tech/)

**Description**: SolQuest is a decentralized learning platform built on Solana, designed to educate developers through interactive, quest-based learning. The platform mimics the concept of Speedrun Ethereum, but focuses on the Solana blockchain, offering step-by-step challenges (quests) that guide developers through building real-world applications on Solana

**Tech Stack**: Solana Blockchain, Rust, Anchor, JavaScript, MDX, Nextjs, Reactjs
